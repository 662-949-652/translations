# Hi, hallo, ol√°, bonjour, ciao, ahoj, opa!

With the help of the beautifully diverse community that makes up [Fetlife](https://fetlife.com/), we are working to make FetLife home to all kinksters, no matter where in the world they might be, and in the language they are most comfortable!

## How we Manage Translations

To manage our translations we use GitHub. If you've ever programmed you are probably familiar with GitHub, or at the very least, version control.

If you are not familiar with GitHub, then it can be overwhelming at first, but once you get comfortable with it you will wonder how you ever lived without it.

The best place to learn about GitHub is through the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com).  

## Helping Out

You can help out in multiple ways, and you don't even need to be multilingual to do so:

- [Report any grammatical issues] you come across in any language, including English, on FetLife.
- Submit improvements to our existing translations.
- Translate FetLife into a language you are fluent in.

### Submitting Improvements to Existing Translations

To suggest improvements to our existing translations you will need to:

- Fork this repository
- Create a new branch
- Make the appropriate changes
- Open a pull request with us

All new translations have to be vetted by pull request before being merged.

### Translating FetLife to Another Language

That's a big undertaking, but many kinksters will greatly appreciate it the effort and maybe even resurect a statue in your name!

- Fork this repository
- Create a new branch
- Look up the code for your language
- Copy the en.yml file to a new file for your new language
- Name the file language-code.yml *ex. en.yml for english*
- Translate the file
- Open a pull request with us

Even if you don't have the time to do the full translation, you can submit a partial translating and hopefully more people will volunteer to do there part.


## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q. Why is only some page in FetLife translated?**  
We are only translating pages that have been redesigned and made mobile friendly. As we move pages to the new design we make them translatable.
